Overview of STADLE
*********************
Our STADLE is a paradigm-shifting intelligence centric platform for federated, collaborative, and continuous learning.
STADLE stands for Scalable Traceable Adaptive Distributed Learning platform.

In particular, Federated learning, the core capability of STADLE, continuously collects Machine Learning models from distributed devices or clients,
aggregates the collective intelligence, and bring it back to the local devices.
Therefore, Federated Learning (FL) using our STADLE solves the fundamental problems that commonly appear in ML systems such as

- **Privacy**: FL does not require users to upload raw data to cloud servers, thus it improves the privacy-preserving aspect of AI systems by not collecting personal or sensitive data in the cloud.
- **Real-Time Intelligence**: It often takes a lot of time to deliver desired intelligence, and sometimes all the value is gone by the time it is delivered. FL usually does not have to create huge data pipeline and set up conputational resources to deliver high-quality intelligence.
- **Communication Load**: The amount of traffic generated by FL dramatically decreases from classical AI systems due to the difference in data type exchanged.
- **Low Latency**: The delay in communication to obtain collective intelligence can be dramatically reduced by employing decentralized FL servers located at edge servers.

Our STADLE platform is horizontally designed and enhances the capability of FL.

- **Scalability**: Decentralized FL servers in STADLE realizes the load-balancing to accommodate more users and create semi-global models which does not require a central master aggregator node.
- **Traceability**: Our platform has the performance tracking capability that monitors and manages the transition of collective intelligence models in the decentralized system.
- **Adaptability**: Static intelligence procduced by big data systems gets outdated and underperform easily while the adaptive intelligence is created by a well designed distributd resilient learning framework that perfectly sync up the local and global models.


General Terminologies
*********************

There are 3 main components in STADLE.

- Persistence Server

  - A core functionality which helps in keeping track of various database entries.
  - Packaged as a command inside `stadle` library.
  - `stadle persistence-server [args]`

- Aggregator

  - A core FL server functionality that conducts aggregation process.
  - Packaged as a command inside `stadle` library.
  - `stadle aggregator [args]`

- Agent

  - A core functionality and libraries that help integrating the local ML engine and/or models into the STADLE platform.
  - In charge of communicating with `stadle` core functions.
  - Packaged inside `stadle` library as a class.
  - `from stadle import BasicClient / IntegratedClient`
  - `class BasicClient / IntegratedClient` is used to integrate training, testing, validation functions of the local ML process.
